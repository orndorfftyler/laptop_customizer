# Laptop Customizer

In this exercise, I started off with a functional non-React webpage and then broke it up into components and rebuilt it using React. The page gives the user a "cart" view where they can choose parts for a custom laptop and see an updated total cost.

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.
